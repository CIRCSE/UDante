# UDante
This repository contains the Gold Standard (GS), annotated by an UD expert, created in the context of the UDante project that has the aim of developing a new treebank  containing  all  of  Dante  Alighieri’s Latin works. Texts were taken from the [DanteSearch](https://dantesearch.dantenetwork.it) corpus: the original TEI-XML files, which were already manually lemmatised and morphologically tagged, were converted into the CoNLL-U format and then syntactically annotated using [ConlluEditor](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/conllueditor).

The GS includes:
- 33 sentences of increasing complexity used to train four annotators
- 10 sentences per work
